Why do we need these libraries. explain in one to two points why we need it

Here is a brief explanation of why we need each of the libraries in the given code:

pandas: This library is used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrame, which makes it easy to load, manipulate, and analyze tabular data like the dataset in your task.

numpy: A library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for working with arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions. In this code, it is not explicitly used, but it serves as a dependency for other libraries like pandas and scikit-learn.

seaborn: A statistical data visualization library built on top of matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. In this code, it is used for creating count plots for exploratory data analysis.

matplotlib.pyplot: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is used in this code for displaying the count plots generated by seaborn.

sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split: A function for splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets, which helps in evaluating the performance of machine learning models.

sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler: A utility for scaling features to have zero mean and unit variance, which helps in improving the performance of certain machine learning algorithms.

sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression: Provides the implementation of the logistic regression algorithm for classification tasks.

sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier: Provides the implementation of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm for classification tasks.

sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier: Provides the implementation of the decision tree algorithm for classification tasks.

sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier: Provides the implementation of the random forest algorithm for classification tasks.

sklearn.metrics: A module containing various evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of machine learning models. In this code, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score, and confusion_matrix are imported to evaluate the classifiers' performance.
